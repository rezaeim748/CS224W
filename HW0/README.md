# Graph Mining and Neural Networks

This repository contains the **Colab 0** notebook from the CS224W course, which introduces key concepts in graph mining and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The notebook focuses on familiarizing students with two essential Python packages for graph analysis:

- **NetworkX**: A powerful library for the creation, manipulation, and analysis of complex networks.
- **PyTorch Geometric**: A deep learning extension library that allows the implementation and training of Graph Neural Networks.

## Overview of Colab 0:
- **Purpose**: This Colab is designed to introduce students to basic graph mining concepts and tools that will be crucial for future assignments in the course.
- **Key Sections**:
  1. **NetworkX Tutorial**: Basic operations in graph creation, manipulation, and visualization using NetworkX.
  2. **PyTorch Geometric Introduction**: A high-level introduction to graph neural network operations using PyTorch Geometric (detailed concepts will be covered in later lectures).

## How to Use:
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rezaeim748/CS224W
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   The following Python packages are required:
   ```bash
   pip install scipy networkx torch-geometric
   ```
3. **Run the Notebook**:
   Open the notebook in a Jupyter environment or Google Colab and execute the cells in sequence to explore graph mining techniques.
